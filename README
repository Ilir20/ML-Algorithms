The final code is located in code/branches/Final_submission folder.

H_Cluster_Finished.ipynb is the one part of the  final code submission. It is a Jupyter Notebook containing the script implementing hierarchical clustering.

K_Means_Finished.ipynb is the other part of the final code submission. It is a Jupyter Notebook containing the script implementing K-means clustering.

These two are the final code submissions. 

The code loads datasets that are included in the code/branches/Final_submission/data folder.
The code allows for different datasets to be loaded for examination.

The code/branches/Final_submission/models folder is for saving the Excel spreadsheets from the notebooks.
